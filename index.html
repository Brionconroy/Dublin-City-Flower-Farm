            <p>
                Let me introduce myself. My name is Geraldine Scully, and I have lived and gardened in Dublin for many years. About ten years ago, I decided I would like to have a ‘cutting garden’ specifically for cut flowers for my house. My home garden not being suitable, due to very dry growing conditions, I was lucky enough to acquire the use of a small portion of land not too far from where I live, and so the adventure began.  
            <br>
                By the end of the first Summer, I was gifting flowers to friends and neighbours, and flushed with success,  I realised that there was potential for a small business supplying fresh flowers to florists who might be open to the idea of Irish grown, pesticide free, freshly picked glorious Dublin grown blooms.  
            <br>
                I was lucky enough to meet a florist, almost immediately who shared my vision and so my roller coaster ride as Dublin City Flower Farm began in earnest. I grow on the smallest ‘flower farm’ in Ireland, so I have had to learn how to pack the plants into small spaces, to achieve enough flowers to sell! I grow from seed, using no pesticides or chemicals, using only home- made or organic fertiliser. The natural world  is important to me, and producing flowers that have no air miles,  are not dipped and sprayed and hot housed is not only be beneficial for the environment, but for our own well being. 
            <br>
                In a good year the season is from mid-April to mid October., with a very small number of flowers available in early Spring. My flowers have featured in wedding in many well known magazines, and it always makes me proud to see those Dublin Flowers in arrangement created by the most talented Florists I know.
