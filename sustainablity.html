        <h2>What is sustainable Flower Farming?</h2>

        <br>

        <p>
 While there is no hard and fast definition, we are generally talking about flowers that are locally
grown and packaged in a way that uses only recyclable and biodegradable material (no plastic or
floral foam). By buying locally, you can be sure that the flowers in your bouquet have allowed
pollinators to thrive and helped bees produce honey, before they ever reach your vase. They will not
have been sprayed with pesticides and fungicides, and have no air miles. You will not only be
supporting pollinators and the environment in general, but also small Irish businesses, and that is
something to cherish and be proud of.
<br>
Flowers grown in Ireland delight the senses, and in sent alone, they cannot be equalled by anything
imported. People often remark that a bouquet of Irish flowers reminds them of their childhood, their
father’s garden or a bouquet in their grandmother’s kitchen. Imported flowers will never evoke this
response. Flower farmers in Ireland are pushing the boundaries and, since dried flowers are back in
vogue, many now supply flowers year round.
<br>
Next time you are ordering flowers for a gift, a memorial, or as a present to yourself, think Irish
flowers and contact one of the many flower farmers on the Irish Flower Farmers website. These
gardeners will be only too happy to hear from you, and will carefully cut and curate a wonderful,
environmentally friendly, and sustainably produced bouquet.
<br>
As we become more conscious of damage to the environment, buying flowers that are locally grown
and thrive in Ireland’s climate, is a real way of making a difference. We need to tread more lightly on
the earth, and a gift of flowers should not mean leaving a footprint that lasts for years in landfill.
